Can you define, in terms of Category Theory concepts, the following mathematical terms:  2-Category, Abelian Category, Abelian Group,
Absurd Function, Addition Preserving, Adjunction, Algebraic Structure, Algebraic Types, Algebras, Anamorphism, Applicative Functor,
Arrow, Associative symmetry, Automorphism

Sure, here are brief explanations of each of the mathematical terms you listed in terms of Category Theory concepts:

2-Category: A 2-category is a category whose objects, morphisms, and morphism-morphisms (also known as 2-cells) form three separate classes, with the latter being morphisms between morphisms.

Abelian Category: An abelian category is a category in which there is a zero object, all morphisms have kernels and cokernels, and every morphism can be written as the difference of two monomorphisms.

Abelian Group: An abelian group is a group whose operation (usually denoted by "+") is commutative.

Addition Preserving: A function is said to be addition preserving if it preserves the operation of adding two elements of a set.

Adjunction: Given two functors F: C → D and G: D → C, an adjunction is a pair of natural transformations (unit and counit) between the functors such that the composite functors GF and FG are isomorphic to the identity functors on C and D respectively.

Algebraic Structure: An algebraic structure is a set equipped with one or more operations that satisfy certain axioms. Examples include groups, rings, and fields.

Algebraic Types: Algebraic types are data types that can be defined using algebraic operations, such as sums and products.

Algebras: Algebras are structures that consist of a set and one or more operations on that set that satisfy certain axioms.

Anamorphism: An anamorphism is a type of coalgebraic structure that is dual to an algebra.

Applicative Functor: An applicative functor is a functor that allows the application of a function to an argument in a context.

Arrow: In Category Theory, an arrow is a morphism between two objects.

Associative symmetry: A binary operation is said to have associative symmetry if it is both associative and commutative

Automorphism: An automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.

Define the mathematical terms you used within the definitions.
Sure, here are brief explanations of the mathematical terms used in the previous definitions:

Category: A category is a collection of objects and morphisms between those objects, with a composition operation that allows the composition of morphisms.

Morphism: In category theory, a morphism is a structure-preserving map between two objects.

Kernel: Given a morphism f: X → Y, the kernel of f is the subobject of X consisting of all elements that are mapped to the zero element of Y by f.

Cokernel: Given a morphism f: X → Y, the cokernel of f is the quotient object of Y consisting of all elements that are in the image of f.

Monomorphism: A monomorphism is a morphism that is both injective and a left inverse.

Functor: A functor is a map between categories that preserves the structure of the categories.

Natural Transformation: A natural transformation is a way of transforming one functor into another while preserving the structure of the categories.

Coalgebra: A coalgebra is a structure that consists of a set and a single operation, called the comultiplication, that describes how to split an element of the set into a collection of smaller elements.

Sums and Products: In Category theory, the product of two objects is an object that has morphisms to each of the original objects and the sum of two objects is an object that has morphisms from each of the original objects.

Set: A set is a collection of elements.

Operation: An operation is a function that takes one or more elements of a set and returns another element of that set.

Axioms: An axiom is a statement or rule that is assumed to be true without proof.

Isomorphism: An isomorphism is a bijective map between two objects that preserves the structure of the objects.

Composition: Composition is a way of combining morphisms to create a new morphism.

Zero object: In category theory, a zero object is an object having no non-trivial morphisms from or to it.

Binary operation: A binary operation is a function that takes two elements of a set and returns another element of that set.

Associative: A binary operation is said to be associative if the order of applying the operation does not affect the result.

Commutative: A binary operation is said to be commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result.

clarify the difference between associative and commutative
Associativity and commutativity are two different properties that a binary operation can have.

Associativity: A binary operation is said to be associative if the order of applying the operation does not affect the result. For example, the operation of addition (+) is associative, because (3 + 2) + 1 = 3 + (2 + 1) = 6.

Commutativity: A binary operation is said to be commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result. For example, the operation of addition (+) is commutative, because 3 + 2 = 2 + 3 = 5.

It is worth noting that not all binary operations are both associative and commutative. For example, subtraction (-) is not commutative because 3-2 is not equal to 2-3.

Also, some operations are commutative but not associative, for example, the operation of multiplication () is commutative but not necessarily associative, because 23 = 32 = 6 but (23)4 != 2(3*4)

In summary, associativity is a property of a binary operation that says that the order of applying the operation doesn't affect the result, while commutativity is a property of a binary operation that says that the order of the operands doesn't affect the result.

but  multiplication is associative 
I apologize for the confusion, you are correct that multiplication is both associative and commutative, I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer.

Multiplication is associative, which means that (23)4 = 2(34) = 24. The parentheses can be rearranged freely without changing the result.

and it is also commutative, which means that 23 = 32 = 6. The order of the operands does not affect the result.

I apologize for the confusion and any confusion my previous answer may have caused.
