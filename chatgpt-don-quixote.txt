Why did Don Quixote joust with windmills?
In the novel "Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes, the character Don Quixote believes that windmills are giants and that jousting with them is a noble and heroic task. He is under the delusion that he is a knight-errant and that it is his duty to defend the helpless and fight against evil. He is driven by his imagination and his desire to live the chivalric ideal, which he has read about in books. He sees the windmills as a challenge to his valor and sets out to defeat them, not realizing that they are inanimate machines and not giant enemies. This episode is one of the most famous and iconic moments in the novel, and is often used to illustrate Don Quixote's delusions and the theme of the novel, which is the difference between reality and fantasy.
