Isn't the correct story that Kai was hitchhiking and in a car when the driver of that car started making racist comments and intentionally pinned a black utility worker against a truck.  When a woman tried to help the utility worker, the car driver attacked the woman.  Kai saved the woman by hitting her attacker with a hatchet and later recounted the event to a news anchor.
